## Simple Kotlin chat application

> Currently the app is only an auth module and doesn't even have chat
capabilities.
> Early days are early.

This project serves as a learning and training ground for developing a Kotlin
Multiplatform (KMP) chat application augmented with AI capabilities.
As an ongoing endeavor, the app is being crafted using Clean Architecture
principles and targets multiple platforms including Web, Linux, Windows and Android.

Intel and Apple Silicon Mac are also supported but the .dmg is not signed.

iOs support may happen later.
