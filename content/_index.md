## Overlay sharing mouse cursor

Display the mouse position of your friends on your own screen so that they
can point things you missed.

This app controls a transparent overlay which tracks your mouse cursor and
displays the cursor of the other participants.

This is mostly intended as a tool to play Point and Click games over the Internet
while these are usually inherently solo games.

It could be used for collaborative purposes as well.
